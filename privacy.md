# Nyte Gallery Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 10 November 2026

Nyte Gallery is a private photo vault for Android, made by **Nytefall Interactive** ("we", "us").
This policy explains what happens to your information when you use the app.

## Summary

- Your photos stay on your phone, encrypted. We never receive them.
- There are no accounts, no ads, no analytics and no tracking.
- The app has no internet access. Nothing you store in it leaves your phone through the app. We collect and share
  no data.
- Lock recovery is offline, with a recovery code only you have (see "Recovery code" below).

## Photos you move into the vault

Photos you move into Nyte Gallery are encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and stored in the app's private storage on your
device. The encryption key is kept in the Android Keystore on your phone and cannot be exported. We do not run
servers that receive your photos, and we cannot see them.

Photo names, dates, the folders you create (their names, order and cover photo) and Trash status are kept in an
index file inside the app's private storage on your device. This index is not sent anywhere.

After you move photos in, the app asks whether to remove the originals from your normal gallery or keep them. If you
choose to remove them, Android may ask you to confirm. If you keep them, the originals stay where they are. When you restore a photo back to your gallery, it is saved as a normal,
unencrypted photo in `Pictures/Nyte Gallery`.

## No accounts, ads or analytics

Nyte Gallery has no sign-in and no user accounts. It shows no ads and does not include analytics, crash
reporting, advertising or tracking tools. We do not sell your data.

## Purchases

Buying Nyte Gallery is handled by Google Play, which processes payment and purchase information under
[Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Nytefall Interactive does not receive your
card or payment details. The app itself still collects nothing and does not connect to the internet.

## Permissions

- **Photos / storage** (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, or on Android 14 and later optionally only the photos you select;
  older Android versions use the storage permission): only so you can choose photos to move into the vault, remove
  the originals if you ask, and put photos back into your gallery when you restore them.
- **Notifications:** to show progress while a long task (moving photos, restoring, backing up) runs.
- **Fingerprint:** fingerprint unlock is handled by Android. The app only learns whether the check succeeded; it
  never receives your fingerprint data.

The app does not request internet access, and does not use your camera, microphone, location or contacts.

## App lock

If you turn on the app lock, your password, PIN or pattern is stored on your device only as a salted hash,
never in plain text. It is not sent anywhere. After several wrong tries, the app makes you wait before trying again.

## Recovery code

When you set up the app lock, the app shows you a recovery code once. Only a salted hash of it is stored on your
device; the code itself is never stored in plain text and never sent anywhere. If you forget how to unlock, you can
enter the recovery code to set a new lock, and you then get a new code. **We cannot recover or reset your recovery
code.** If you lose it and forget your lock, the photos in the vault cannot be opened.

Earlier test versions could email a recovery code through a third-party service. That feature has been removed,
and any recovery email stored by an earlier version is deleted from your device when you create a recovery code.

## Backups

Backups are created only when you choose. Each backup file contains the vault's photos, their names and dates, and your folders, and is encrypted with a
password you set, and is saved
wherever you pick using Android's file picker (for example a phone folder, a memory card, or a cloud drive you
use). We never receive the backup file or the password, and **we cannot recover a forgotten backup password**.
If you store a backup with a cloud service, that service's own terms apply.

Android's automatic cloud backup is turned off for Nyte Gallery, so the vault is not copied to Google's backup.
The app may remind you to make a backup when photos in the vault aren't in a backup yet. The reminder is checked on
your device only.

## Feedback and links

If you tap "Send feedback", your own email app opens and you decide what to send. If you email us, we receive your
email address and your message, and use them only to reply. "Privacy policy" and "Terms of service" open in your
browser.

## Deleting your data

All app data is on your device. Uninstalling Nyte Gallery or clearing its storage permanently deletes the vault,
the index, the app lock settings and the encryption key on that device. Photos still in the vault are then gone
for good unless you have a backup file. Photos in Trash are deleted automatically after 30 days, or right away if
you empty Trash. Backup files you saved are not deleted by the app; you manage them yourself.

Because we have no accounts or servers, we hold no data about you to delete. You can still contact us with any
question.

## Children

Nyte Gallery is not directed at children under 13.

## Changes

We will update this page if the way the app handles data changes, for example if paid features are added. The
effective date above shows when it last changed.
